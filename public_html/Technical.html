          <h4 class="section-subtitle"> My Background </h4>
          <p>
              As a child, I was always fascinated with building structures using various materials, such as Legos and K’nex.
              I often observed my father, who has a master's degree in computer engineering, as he disassembled computers and put them back together.
          </p>
          <p>
              I began to consider pursuing engineering as a major when I took the course Principles of Engineering in my high school sophomore year.
              I was very interested in the concepts that were introduced in that class and even more excited with the endless possibilities in which they can be applied.
              The final project for this class was to construct and program a miniature functional elevator with other team members, and I was put in charge of programming it.
              I thoroughly enjoyed this project from beginning to end, as well as the challenges that were initially presented when coding.
          </p>
          <p>
              Following this success, I began to delve deeper into the subject of Computer Science with the help of an introductory course that I took in my high school senior year.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4 class="section-subtitle"> Present Day </h4>
          <p>
              I am currently a sophomore at Texas A&M University and plan on graduating in the spring of 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
              I started conducting research with the <a class="link" href="http://nlp.cs.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group</a> in April 2019.
              Our goal is to extract descriptive information using NLP from science fiction passages and novels, then using it to create models.
          </p>
          <p>
              I am also currently involved in <a class="link" href="http://theendeavr.org/" target="_blank">ENDEAVR</a>, an interdisciplinary project which had been introduced in my Machine Learning class.
              By working with other teams in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) departments, our mission is to envision and design plans for “smart” infrastructures in different cities.
              Together, we seek technology-based solutions for challenges including climate change, transportation, and aging populations, and economic growth in order to make the city’s future more sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>
              My favorite languages to program in are C++, Java, and Python. I chose these three languages because I believe that every one of them offers a set of pros and cons that another can make up for.
          </p>
          <p>
              I am certified in <a class="link" href="PythonCertificate.png" target="_blank">Data Science in Python</a> by Cognitiveclass
              and in <a class="link" href="DeepLearningCertificate.png" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision</a> by NVIDIA.
